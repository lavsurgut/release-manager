This tool helps to run long deployment scripts on your target machine automatically.
If you ever tried to find a solution for your long running script 
and didn't wannt to spend time monitoring it alone in a late night office, 
you may find it useful.

It can:
1) Run scripts sequentially
2) Run scripts in parallel
3) Output log into the file or anywhere else
4) Possible to connect to db, servers...(although for now it contains only an example for Oracle)
